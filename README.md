# TMDb App

TMDb App is a desktop app which you can find and save movies into your personal account.

The purpose of the project is authenticate user and keep his/her data in firebase cloud database. 
I also tried using react-router v6 more effective. 
Context API is preferred for state management.

I am inspired from Stpehen Kempin's TMDb project in terms of design perspective.
